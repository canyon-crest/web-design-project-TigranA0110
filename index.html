    <h2>Three Paragraphs about me</h2>
    <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p>I was born in Moscow, Russia, on April 1st, 2009. My ethnicity is Armenian. About a year after I was born, my parents had my younger brother. We lived in a studio in the city. After a few years, we moved to a house in a small community outside of the city. Most of my memories are from there, but I do remember the city. There was a little river next to our house in the forest through which fresh water ran. We would often go there to drink from it or to use the shower area, which was a small wooden box with a shower head connected to the river. There was also a set of train tracks where my brother and I would always go to sit and talk. During the winter, when it snowed, we would ride our bikes around the neighborhood, and our dad would make a big slide in our backyard while we were out riding. The neighborhood’s name is “<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Novoye+Stupino,+Verzilovo,+Moscow+Oblast,+Russia,+142821/@55.0269055,38.0980077,14z/data=!4m16!1m9!3m8!1s0x41357848b819d067:0x1d80f58339e32f71!2sNovoye+Stupino,+Verzilovo,+Moscow+Oblast,+Russia,+142821!3b1!8m2!3d55.0269055!4d38.0980077!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F120z1x59!3m5!1s0x41357848b819d067:0x1d80f58339e32f71!8m2!3d55.0269055!4d38.0980077!16s%2Fg%2F120z1x59?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">новое ступино</a>” or Novoye Stupino in English. I know 3 different languages, Russian, Armenian, and English.</p>

    <h3>Weekends</h3>
    <p>I really love cars, so I try to go to a car meet in Rancho Santa Fe every weekend. It’s full of cool and expensive cars, and it’s awesome to see them up close. I can’t always go because of school, but when I do, I usually go with my brother or friends. I’ve seen some amazing cars there over time. I went a lot more during the summer than I do now that school’s started.</p>

    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <p>My family and I have always loved traveling. When I was young, my parents would take time off work to travel, and even after moving to the US, we continued to explore different places within the country, such as Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. My dad, brother and I are planning to visit Dubai in the coming weeks during week off</p>
